Data-Structure:
=======
the data structure that the assignment is built on is a simple graph.
for info about this type of graph you can visit: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory].
here are the classes of this data structure:
| class | description |
| ------|:-----------:|
| GraphElements| contains two classes, NodeData, which represents the vertex on the graph, and EdgeData, which represents the edge connecting two vertices. |
| DiGraph | this class contains various methods that can be used on the graph, such as adding/deleting a node, connects/disconnect vertices via edges etc. |
| GraphAlgo|this class contains more complex method that can be apllied on the graph, such as shortest-path algorithm and Tarjan SCC algorithm.|
